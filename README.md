This project creates an interactive mouse tracker animation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. As you move your mouse across the screen, it leaves a trail of fading circles, creating a visually appealing effect. The project also includes a color selection feature, allowing users to customize the colors of the trail.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mouse-tracker-animation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd mouse-tracker-animation
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

That's it! No additional installation or setup is required as this project uses vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
2. Move your mouse around the screen to see the tracking animation.
3. Use the color pickers in the top-left corner to customize the start and end colors of the trail.

## Customization

You can easily customize various aspects of the animation:

- **Trail Length**: Modify the `trailLength` variable in the JavaScript code to change the length of the trail.
- **Circle Size**: Adjust the size calculation in the `drawTrail` function to change the size of the circles.
- **Animation Speed**: The animation speed is tied to the browser's refresh rate. For more control, you could implement a custom timing mechanism.
